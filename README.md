The Wolfenstein 3D renderer is a 2.5D raycasting engine used in the classic first-person shooter Wolfenstein 3D (released in 1992). Although the game uses a 2D map with walls and floors, the engine simulates a 3D perspective using raycasting to create the illusion of three-dimensionality. Let's break down how the renderer works:
Key Concepts Behind the Renderer:

    2D Map Representation:
        The world is represented as a grid of walls (usually consisting of values like 0 for open space and 1 for walls).
        The player’s position and orientation are also defined in this 2D space.

    Raycasting:
        The renderer casts rays from the player’s viewpoint into the virtual world to determine what objects or walls are in view.
        For each vertical line of pixels on the screen, a ray is cast in the direction corresponding to the player's viewpoint.
        The ray continues until it hits a wall or an obstacle.
        The distance from the player to the wall determines the height of the wall on the screen, which creates the illusion of 3D.

How the Rendering Process Works:

    Player Position and Direction:
        The player has a position (x, y) on the 2D map and a viewing angle (or direction) that determines the direction of the rays cast.
        The player can move, which updates the (x, y) coordinates, and can rotate to change the viewing angle.

    Casting Rays:
        For each vertical column of pixels on the screen (representing the player's field of view), the renderer casts a ray into the virtual world.
        The angle of the ray is determined by the player's viewing direction and the screen's horizontal position.
        The ray moves forward in small steps, checking for intersections with the walls (or grid cells marked as walls) on the map.

    Wall Collision Detection:
        As the ray moves forward, it checks for collisions with walls. When it hits a wall, the algorithm records the distance from the player to the wall.
        The farther the wall is, the shorter the height of the wall on the screen (this creates a perspective effect where closer walls appear taller).

    Drawing the Wall:
        The height of the wall on the screen is inversely proportional to the distance between the player and the wall.
        The renderer draws a vertical line on the screen for each column of pixels, where the height corresponds to the distance.
        For walls that are closer to the player, the line is taller; for farther walls, the line is shorter.
        This gives the illusion of a 3D environment, even though it's just a 2D grid of walls.

    Texture Mapping:
        Wolfenstein 3D uses wall textures to create a more realistic appearance. The renderer takes the point where the ray hits the wall and maps a portion of the texture to the corresponding column of pixels on the screen.
        This texture mapping is simple, but effective for creating the illusion of depth.

    Shading:
        To simulate light and depth, shading is applied to the walls based on their distance from the player. The farther a wall is, the dimmer or darker it will appear.

    Floor and Ceiling:
        After rendering the walls, the renderer draws the floor and ceiling. These are typically rendered as simple color fills (instead of detailed textures).
        The floor and ceiling are drawn by projecting rays from the player’s viewpoint, similar to how walls are drawn, but they don't require raycasting for individual pixels. Instead, they are simply drawn based on the player's height and angle.

Simplified Overview of the Rendering Pipeline:

    For each vertical slice of the screen (representing a column of pixels):
        Calculate the angle of the ray corresponding to the screen position.
        Cast the ray and find where it intersects with a wall.
        Calculate the distance from the player to the wall.
        Based on the distance, calculate the height of the wall on the screen.
        Apply texture mapping for the wall.
        Shade the wall based on its distance.

    For the floor and ceiling:
        Draw the floor and ceiling using simple color fills or basic textures.

Advantages of Raycasting (Wolfenstein 3D):

    Performance: Raycasting is more efficient than full 3D rendering techniques like ray tracing, allowing it to run on hardware with limited resources (like the early 1990s PCs).
    Simple 2D Map: The world can be represented as a 2D grid, which simplifies level design while still providing the illusion of 3D environments.
    Faster Rendering: Unlike true 3D rendering engines, the raycasting engine only needs to handle the visible surfaces (walls) and doesn't need to compute a full 3D model of the world, which saves on computational power.

Limitations of Wolfenstein's Renderer:

    Limited to 2D Maps: Although it creates the illusion of 3D, the world is still fundamentally 2D, and the game cannot handle things like diagonal walls or complex 3D objects.
    No True 3D Depth: The game can't render things like rooms inside other rooms or complex 3D objects such as stairs with the same depth as true 3D engines.

Conclusion:

The Wolfenstein 3D renderer uses raycasting to simulate 3D environments with simple 2D grid-based maps. By casting rays to detect wall collisions and adjusting wall heights based on their distance from the player, it creates the illusion of depth and immersion without requiring full 3D geometry. This efficient technique allowed Wolfenstein 3D to run on the limited hardware of the early '90s while offering an innovative experience that influenced the development of future 3D games.
